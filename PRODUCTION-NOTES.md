# Production Deployment Notes

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ **Service Worker Registration**
- **Issue**: App was trying to register `/sw.js` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Commented out service worker registration in both HTML and JS
- **Action**: Create `sw.js` file if PWA features are needed

### ✅ **Audio Notification System**
- **Issue**: Corrupted base64 audio data causing media load failures
- **Fix**: Replaced with Web Audio API programmatic beep generation
- **Benefit**: No external audio files needed, cleaner sound generation

### ✅ **Script Loading**
- **Issue**: HTML was referencing `script.js` instead of the actual `src/js/app.js`
- **Fix**: Updated script tag to load correct file as ES6 module
- **Note**: App uses ES6 modules with proper imports

### ⚠️ **Tailwind CSS CDN**
- **Issue**: Using CDN version not recommended for production
- **Current**: Added warning comment in HTML
- **Recommendation**: For production deployment:
  ```bash
  npm install tailwindcss
  npx tailwindcss init
  npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
  ```
